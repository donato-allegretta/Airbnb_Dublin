# Airbnb Dublin Analysis
This project utilised data from Inside Airbnb to analyse the Dublin Airbnb market. The analysis focused on various aspects of the data, including the number of listings and hosts in Dublin, hosts with multiple listings, pricing trends, revenue potential, reviews and ratings, superhost status, instant booking, and availability.

The project began with an exploration of the data, revealing that there are currently 7,836 unique listings in Dublin, managed by 5,538 unique hosts. The majority of hosts (83%) have only one listing, while some hosts have multiple listings.

The pricing analysis involved cleaning the price variable and examining the average prices across different neighborhoods and room types. It was found that properties in Dublin City are priced significantly higher than in other neighborhoods, and entire homes/apartments are in high demand.

The revenue potential analysis focused on identifying the most profitable properties based on projected revenue. It was observed that entire homes in Dublin City, regardless of the location, have the highest revenue potential.

The project also analysed the reviews and ratings, considering the number of reviews per listing and identifying hosts with the most negative comments about dirty properties. Furthermore, the relationship between superhost status, price, ratings, and revenue potential was explored. Regular hosts were found to charge more than superhosts, while superhosts received better ratings.

The impact of instant booking on revenue potential was investigated, revealing that regular bookings obtained better revenues than instant bookings. Additionally, it was observed that hosts with instant book enabled had higher availability, suggesting they receive fewer reservations.

The project concluded by highlighting the potential opportunities for improvement within the Airbnb platform. The findings suggested that hosts could benefit from better pricing strategies and greater awareness of the advantages of instant booking. Airbnb could also consider optimizing search results and providing incentives to hosts to maximize their earnings.
